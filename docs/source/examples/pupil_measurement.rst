Pupil Measurement Examples
==========================

This section contains comprehensive examples for working with individual pupil measurements.



Overview
--------

Start with the first notebook to understand the basic concepts, then progress through
the examples based on your specific analysis needs. Each notebook builds upon
concepts from previous examples while remaining self-contained.
