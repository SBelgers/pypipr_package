2. **Data Exploration**: Visualization techniques and data inspection
3. **Preprocessing**: Filtering, baseline correction, and blink detection
4. **Analysis**: Metric calculation and comprehensive fitting methods
5. **Advanced Topics**: Custom analysis workflows and quality control
6. **Applications**: Light color comparisons and result export

Getting Started
---------------

Start with the first notebook to understand the basic concepts, then progress through
the examples based on your specific analysis needs. Each notebook builds upon
concepts from previous examples while remaining self-contained.
