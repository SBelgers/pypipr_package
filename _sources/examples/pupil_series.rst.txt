Overview
--------

The pupil series examples demonstrate:

1. **Data Management**: Loading and organizing multiple measurements
2. **Batch Processing**: Efficient preprocessing of multiple datasets
3. **Parallel Computing**: Accelerating analysis with parallel processing
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Trial comparisons and habituation studies
5. **Quality Assessment**: Consistency metrics and monitoring
6. **Advanced Visualization**: Series-specific plotting techniques
7. **Experimental Design**: Support for various experimental paradigms

Workflow
--------

These examples are designed for researchers working with multiple pupil measurements
or longitudinal studies. Start with series loading and exploration, then proceed
to batch processing and analysis techniques that match your research questions.
